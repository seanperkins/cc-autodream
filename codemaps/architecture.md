## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `bin/run.sh` | orchestrator: guard, enumerate+filter, L1 retry loop, changelog, L2 retry loop, notify, gc |
| `bin/autodream-now.sh` | run NOW via a transient one-shot launchd agent (escapes the ~10-min cap on bg tasks/ssh). `[DATE] [--force] [--watch] [--dry-run]`. RunAtLoad only (no kickstart → no double run); picks the scheduled plist that runs `run.sh` for its label namespace |
| `bin/prune-self-sessions.sh` | self-session predicate (single source of truth): list / `--delete` / `--filter` |
| `bin/oversized-gate.sh` | recompute the #12 measurement gate over a trailing window from the sidecars/findings on disk (`--days N`, or explicit findings dirs). Recovers dates whose `run-stats.txt` predates the counters; artifacts only, no model calls |
| `bin/root-probe.sh` | detect the `~/.claude*/projects` buckets and decide which to index. `--consolidated`/`--unindexed`/`--list` (read-only, nightly), `--ask`/`--default-index` (install-time; writes root-choices.conf + the managed `SESSION_ROOTS` config section). Artifacts only, no model calls |
| `bin/linearize-omp-session.sh` | OMP (oh-my-pi) source ingest: collapse a session's entry tree to the live leaf chain, root-first, dropping abandoned branches. Emits a leading `type:"autodream_meta"` JSON record (session id, `cwd`, entry/on-path/dropped counts, plus `nested`/`parent_session_file` from directory provenance — a child lives in a dir named after its parent session file). Fails closed (nonzero, no output) on a non-OMP file, an unparseable line, a cycle, or a dangling `parentId` — the caller must skip the session, never fall back to the raw file. Artifacts only, no model calls |
| `bin/citation-check.sh` | resolve every 12-hex session citation in a finished report against the findings dir: emits `citations_total` / `citations_unresolved` / `citations_to_gated` / `citations_resolved_by_path` (+ `_list` keys) on stdout, which `run.sh` appends to `run-stats.txt` after L2. Catches L2 attaching real content to the wrong session hash — including a noise-gated stub it never received content for. Resolves both findings hashes and OMP session-UUID tails; matches backticked AND bare hashes; biased to false alarm over false all-clear. Never fatal; exit 2 only when the check could not run. Artifacts only, no model calls |
| `prompts/POLICY_OMP.md` | per-source L1 policy override, appended after `SESSION_TRIAGE.md` for OMP sessions only (dispatch keys on the `<hash>.norm.jsonl` sidecar). Translates harness surfaces (lowercase tools, `xd://` devices, mnemopi vs `MEMORY.md`, omp config vs `.claude/settings.json`), retires the Claude-only rules (`compliance_markers` absence is descriptive), and maps harness-specific observations onto the existing closed category list. The Claude prompt is untouched, so Claude triage cannot regress |
| `bin/notify.sh` | extract "Open questions" → inbox file, counted from the `open-questions=N` marker, opened via `$AUTODREAM_OPEN` |
| `bin/review.sh` | interactive morning triage (`claude --append-system-prompt <report>`); `AUTODREAM_TRIAGE_SURFACE=cmux` (config/env) launches it in its own cmux workspace instead of inline. Skips the session entirely (prints a notice) when the report has 0 open questions or is already triaged — reads the `<!-- autodream:open-questions=N -->` marker, falls back to prose, launches on anything ambiguous; `--force` overrides. Skip check runs before the cmux branch so a skip never spawns a workspace |
| `prompts/SESSION_TRIAGE.md` | L1 prompt: per-session JSON schema |
| `prompts/PROMPT.md` | L2 prompt: report sections incl. Upstream changes + Autodream self-audit, memory rules |
| `tests/run-all.sh` | integration tests for `run.sh` vs `mock-claude.sh` (offline) |
| `tests/review-skip.sh` | tests for `review.sh`'s skip/launch decision (offline; inline mock claude) |
| `tests/mock-claude.sh` | stand-in claude; modes: good / l1_incomplete / l1_flaky |
| `launchd/com.user.autodream.plist.example` | schedule (multi-trigger catch-up + pmset note) |
| `install.sh` | symlink scripts/prompts into `~/.claude/autodream/`; by default also generates + bootstraps the nightly launchd schedule (auto-detected label/PATH/dirs; `--no-schedule` to skip) |

## Key invariants

- L1 worker is **idempotent**: a session with a non-empty `<sha>.json` is skipped. Failures leave no JSON (retry target); deterministic errors (unreadable file) write a JSON (done).
- A `dreams/<date>.md` exists only after a successful L2 → it is the "done" signal for the idempotency guard.
- `prune-self-sessions.sh` matches only the FIRST user turn against autodream's own prompt framing → human sessions about autodream are not false positives.
- claude is always invoked with the lean flags + subscription auth; never `--bare`/`CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE` (breaks auth).

## Environment overrides

All optional; full list (with defaults) is documented in `bin/run.sh`'s header. The ones you reach for most:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_BIN` | `$HOME/.local/bin/claude` | path to `claude` CLI |
| `SESSION_ROOTS` | autodetected | colon-separated dirs to scan for session JSONLs (every `$HOME/.claude*/projects`). Wins over `PROJECTS_DIR` |
| `PROJECTS_DIR` | `$HOME/.claude/projects` | single root, kept for compat (one dir); `WORK_BUCKET` isolation is keyed off this |
| `AUTODREAM_DIR` | `$HOME/.claude/autodream` | scripts + runtime state |
| `DREAMS_DIR` | `$HOME/.claude/dreams` | where reports are written |
| `FANOUT` | `8` | L1 parallelism |
| `AUTODREAM_FORCE` | `0` | `1` rebuilds even if a report exists |
| `AUTODREAM_CHANGELOG` | `1` | `0` skips the upstream-changelog check |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_REPO` / `CHANGELOG_REMOTE` | cache dir / anthropics/claude-code | changelog clone source/cache |
| `AUTODREAM_L1_ROUNDS` / `AUTODREAM_L2_ATTEMPTS` | `5` / `3` | sleep-resilient retry bounds |
| `AUTODREAM_NETCHECK` / `AUTODREAM_RETRY_WAIT` | `1` / `60` | network-wait between retry rounds |
| `AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES` | `262144` | sessions larger than this are slimmed for L1 |
| `AUTODREAM_OPEN` | `open` | how `notify.sh` opens the inbox file; a `sh -c` snippet, so flags work (`subl`, `code -g`, `open -a Obsidian`). `SUBL` is a deprecated alias |
| `AUTODREAM_TRIAGE_SURFACE` | `inline` | `review.sh` triage surface: `inline` (current terminal) or `cmux` (own workspace) |
| `AUTODREAM_TRIAGE_FOCUS` | `false` | cmux surface only: `true` switches to the new workspace on launch, `false` opens it in the background |
| `CMUX_BIN` | `/Applications/cmux.app/.../bin/cmux` then PATH | cmux CLI, used when surface is `cmux` |
| `AUTODREAM_CONFIG` | `$AUTODREAM_DIR/config` | sourced KEY=VALUE config (env vars override it) |

## Lean queries / no self-pollution (see CLAUDE.md for full detail)

- Both layers call `claude --print` with composed lean flags (`--no-session-persistence --disable-slash-commands --strict-mcp-config --settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}'` + `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_MDS=1` …) — minimal footprint while keeping subscription/OAuth auth.
- `--no-session-persistence` stops workers leaving their own transcripts; the enumeration also pipes through `prune-self-sessions.sh --filter` to drop any left by older runs. Without this, ~90% of a night's corpus is autodream re-reading itself.
