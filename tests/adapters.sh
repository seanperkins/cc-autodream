# Unit tests for bin/adapters.sh — loading, identity safety, containment.
#
# The security-relevant assertions here are the last three groups. Dispatch
# builds a command path from the adapter's directory name, so anything that can
# influence that name can influence what gets executed. The manifest is data,
# read with jq and never sourced; the basename is validated; and the directory
# is realpath-contained, because a basename check alone does not stop
# adapters/evil being a symlink to somewhere else entirely.
