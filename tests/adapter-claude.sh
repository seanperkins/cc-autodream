# Cleanup lives in a trap because this suite parks a process that blocks forever
# on purpose. The FIFO test below starts a `slim` whose first read waits for a
# writer that never comes. Both cleanups used to sit on the last lines of the
# file, so a run that ended any other way — Ctrl-C, a harness timeout, an early
# exit — reached neither, and the delegate was reparented to init and blocked
# for good.
#
# Measured, not hypothesised: 22 interrupted runs over about 90 minutes on
# 2026-08-26 left 66 slim-transcript.sh processes alive. They were still there
# nine days later, each holding a FIFO open in a temp directory that had already
# been deleted.
#
# A trap is safe HERE in a way it is not in adapters/claude/adapter.sh, which
# documents the opposite conclusion and issue #57 explains at length. The
# difference is not that this suite is interruptible and that one is not. Bash
# defers a trapped signal until the FOREGROUND child returns in both, and a
# foreground `sleep` is NOT interruptible — measured on bash 5.3.15 and on
# /bin/bash 3.2.57, a trapped TERM sent 1s into `sleep 5` fires at t=5, while
# the same signal during `wait` fires at t=1.
#
# The difference is that the deferral is BOUNDED here and unbounded there. Every
# foreground child in this file is a `sleep 0.05` or faster, so the worst case
# is a signal handled 50ms late. adapter.sh's foreground child is the delegate
# itself, which blocks forever on the FIFO, so a trap there converts a prompt
# death into a hang.
# Reap by PROCESS GROUP, never by name. Two rounds of #62 review went into this
# and both were spent on `pkill -f`, which is the wrong tool twice over: it
# matches an unanchored REGEX, so an interpolated $TMPDIR of /tmp/a[b] silently
# matched nothing, and once $TMPDIR was out of the pattern the mktemp suffix
# still identified the run only probabilistically. A pattern names processes by
# what they look like; the group names exactly the ones this run started.
#
# `set -m` around the launch puts the adapter in its own process group, so the
# delegate and the two bash subshells beneath it inherit that pgid. Killing the
# negative pid reaches all of them in one call, and it keeps working after the
# adapter dies: a reparented child keeps its process group.
