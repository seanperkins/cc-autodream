## Skill coverage gaps
- The report says \`ghost-skill\` is missing, but \`real-skill\` and \`p:plug-skill\` are not.
- Also \`Read\` and \`ghost-skill\` again.

## Proposed action
- Add \`Bash(git status:*)\` and \`Bash(rm -rf:*)\` and \`mcp__srv__tool\` to the allowlist.
- Commit \`$2\` fixed it; \`deadbee0\` did not exist; session \`47eba605cf1e\` is a findings hash.
- A plain \`some-token\` on a line about nothing.
