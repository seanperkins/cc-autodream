# Mock `claude` binary for cc-autodream integration tests.
#
# run.sh invokes the real claude CLI for both layers. Here we stand in for it:
# read the prompt on stdin, find the two literal-path lines run.sh inlined, and
# write (or deliberately don't write) the expected output file — no model, no
# network. Which layer we are is decided by line 1 of the prompt.
#
# Env knobs (all optional):
#   MOCK_MODE=good           write findings (L1) / print the report on stdout (L2), ending with
#                            the AUTODREAM_REPORT_END sentinel. [default]
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_partial_then_stall  exactly ONE session ever succeeds (claimed via an
#                            atomic mkdir under MOCK_STATE_DIR, which the test must set);
#                            round 1 recovers something, every later round recovers
#                            nothing. Pins the circuit breaker's no-progress streak.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_incomplete  L1 writes nothing (simulates a worker that exits
#                            without producing JSON); L2 still writes its report.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_silent      L1 writes nothing and prints nothing, exit 0: the real
#                            2026-09-13 omp death. l1_incomplete still prints "done".
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_malformed   L1 writes a non-empty file that is not JSON.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_wrongtype   L1 writes {"findings":"oops"}: present, but not an array.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_noisy_fail  L1 writes nothing, says why on stdout, exits 7.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_context_overflow  L1 writes nothing, prints a context-size refusal,
#                            and exits 7. This must count as size even though the
#                            diagnostic also starts with "provider error".
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_nested_error  L1 writes a SUCCESSFUL findings file with an "error" key nested
#                            inside a finding. Only a top-level error key marks a failed triage.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_provider_refusal  L1 writes nothing, prints the Z.ai insufficient-balance
#                            429 (code 1113) and exits 1. The network is fine, so this
#                            must defer the date like an outage and never leave a stub.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_provider_402  Same, in DeepSeek's wording: "Error code: 402 - Insufficient
#                            Balance". classify_failure has no 402 pattern, so this proves
#                            the permanent check does not depend on it.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_exit124     L1 exits 124 immediately; MOCK_MODE=l1_exit137 SIGKILLs
#                            itself. Both are what GNU timeout returns for a real
#                            deadline, so they prove classification is not by rc alone.
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_hang        L1 never exits and leaves a child behind, which is the
#                            shape of the 2026-08-19/08-22 wedge. Pair with a small
#                            AUTODREAM_L1_TIMEOUT and MOCK_HANG_PIDS=<file> to assert
#                            the child was reaped with the process group.
#   MOCK_MODE=l2_partial_marker  L2 prints a COMPLETE-LOOKING report (it carries the
#                            open-questions marker) but no sentinel, then exits 0.
#   MOCK_MODE=l2_exit143 / l2_exit137  L2 prints "Execution error" and exits 143 / 137 with no
#                            report: the signal-shaped death of issue 42.
#   MOCK_MODE=l2_fail        L2 prints no report and exits 1 (simulates the
#                            aggregator dying to a mid-run sleep). L1 is unaffected.
#                            Pair with AUTODREAM_L2_ATTEMPTS=1 so the test doesn't
#                            sit through the retry loop.
#   MOCK_MODE=pins           L1 writes a real session_path (like l1_badproject); L2
#                            writes a complete report plus one pins.jsonl pin for proj-a.
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_partial   as pins, but the report is truncated (like l2_partial).
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_forged    L1 writes session_path=$MOCK_FORGED_SESSION, a session it was
#                            never given; L2 pins $MOCK_PIN_PROJECT (default proj-a).
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_tamper    as pins, and L2 also appends $MOCK_FORGED_SESSION to sessions.txt,
#                            sessions-source.txt and a findings JSON, as an injected L2 could.
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_tamper_l1 the same tampering, done by L1 instead of L2.
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_ledger_wipe  as pins, and L1 also empties findings/<date>/pins-applied.tsv.
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_unterminated  as pins, but the pin block has no AUTODREAM_PINS_END line.
#   MOCK_MODE=pins_in_body   the report BODY quotes the pin markers and a pin line; no block after
#                            the sentinel. Nothing may be stored.
#   MOCK_TRIAGE_MODE=fail|nosentinel|empty  the dream-triage call (bin/triage-dream.sh) fails, is cut off
#                            before the sentinel, or delivers nothing. It writes triage-*.txt to
#                            MOCK_CAPTURE_DIR, never l2-*.
#   MOCK_MODE=chunked        L1 answers as one chunk of a longer session (chunk I of N is read from
#                            the chunk note in the prompt): goal-I, a finding unique to the chunk
#                            and one shared by every chunk, outcome fully_achieved on the last
#                            chunk only. A call with no chunk note is answered as in good mode.
#   MOCK_FAIL_CHUNK=N        chunk N fails (every attempt, or only the first with MOCK_FAIL_ONCE=1).
#   MOCK_FAIL_KIND=silent|noisy|context|refusal   how it fails: exit 0 with nothing at all, a
#                            429 on stdout with exit 7, a context overflow with exit 7, or the
#                            Z.ai insufficient-balance refusal with exit 1 (default silent).
#   MOCK_BAD_CHUNK=N         chunk N answers with the WRONG thing, once per output path.
#   MOCK_BAD_KIND=error|nofindings|typed|two   what that wrong answer is (default error): the L1
#                            error object, an object with no findings, findings a string, or two
#                            JSON values in one file.
#   MOCK_TRANSCRIPT_LOG=<file>  append "<transcript path><TAB><its bytes>" for every L1 call, so a
#                            test can prove how much a worker was handed.
#   MOCK_MODEL_LOG=<file>    append "<output path><TAB><model>" for every L1 call.
#   MOCK_CAPTURE_DIR=<dir>   dump each layer's stdin + argv to <dir>/l{1,2}-*.txt
#                            so tests can assert on the exact prompt framing.
#   MOCK_CALL_LOG=<file>     append the L1 output path for every invocation of
#                            this mock, one per line — lets a test prove the
#                            model was (or was not) invoked for a given session
#                            (e.g. a noise-gated session should never appear).
