  # stats and slim delegate like everything else, but they cannot `exec`. Both
  # delegated scripts write the destination directly — slim-transcript.sh in two
  # steps, a `>` for the body and a `>>` for the footer — so an interruption
  # leaves a non-empty file with no footer, and the caller's `-s` check accepts
  # it and sends a truncated session to L1 as if it were whole.
  #
  # The atomicity belongs here rather than in those scripts: the contract is the
  # adapter's (docs/design/unify-harness-adapters-2026-08-23.md:131 requires it
  # of every subcommand that writes a file), and both scripts have callers
  # outside this seam. Same shape as normalize above — a unique temp in the
  # DESTINATION directory, renamed on success, removed on failure.
  #
  # DELIBERATELY NO SIGNAL TRAP, and this was measured rather than assumed. A
  # killed run leaves the temp behind, which is real but cosmetic: nothing reads
  # `*.tmp.*` — the findings glob is `*.json` and slim output is read by exact
  # path. Adding `trap 'rm -f "$t"' ... TERM` costs far more than it saves,
  # because bash defers a TRAPPED signal until the foreground child returns. The
  # delegate is that child, so the trap converts a prompt death into an adapter
  # that ignores SIGTERM for as long as the delegate runs — verified here: the
  # test below hung for 120s and left orphaned slim-transcript.sh processes
  # holding their input open. Being killed mid-flight is this pipeline's normal
  # failure, so trading a stale temp for a hung process is the wrong direction.
  # Backgrounding the delegate and killing it from the trap would work and is
  # five lines of signal plumbing in a file whose whole claim is that nothing is
  # invented here. The runner sweeps `*.tmp.??????` and `*.pre.jsonl` out of the findings
  # dir at the start of each run (sweep_killed_leftovers in bin/run.sh, #57).
