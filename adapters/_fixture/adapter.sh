# A synthetic harness whose only purpose is to prove the adapter contract is a
# contract rather than a description of what the claude adapter happens to do.
#
# Its session format is one JSON object per file with `cwd` and `turns`. That
# resembles neither real harness deliberately: a fixture shaped like a Claude
# transcript would pass by accident, and would keep passing if the contract
# quietly grew a Claude-specific assumption.
#
# Excluded from the default adapter set by its leading underscore, so a nightly
# run never sees it. It declares writes_memory:false, which also makes it the
# fixture for the no-store routing path.

    # create a directory at $2 between the two, and `mv` then moves the temp
    # INSIDE it and returns 0 — success reported with no output written, which
    # is the exact failure the guard exists to stop. macOS has no `mv -T`, so
    # the destination is verified to be a regular file afterwards and the stray
    # removed. Verified by deleting the guard above: this alone still satisfies
    # the directory-destination contract test, so it is a real backstop and not
    # decoration. The guard stays anyway — it fails before any work, and it is
    # what stops a file appearing inside the caller's directory even briefly.

    # This NARROWS the race rather than closing it. A sequence that creates a
    # directory at $2 after the guard, lets mv move the temp inside it, then
    # replaces $2 with a regular file before this check, still reports success
    # with the output somewhere else. Closing that needs an atomic
    # rename-if-not-a-directory, which is renameat2 on Linux and does not exist
    # on macOS, where this runs. Winning any of these needs write access to the
    # findings dir, at which point the dir is already the attacker's; these
    # checks exist because silent wrong success is the failure this repo keeps
    # getting caught by, not because there is a threat model. Named here rather
    # than papered over with a fourth layer that would not close it either.
