# Count how many consecutive reports have carried the same open question, and escalate the
# ones that have gone unanswered too long.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Detection was never the problem. The X bookmarks walk broke on 2026-09-05; every report
# from then to 09-14 said `x_queryid_source: failed`, and the Open questions section asked
# "Fix the X bookmarks walker, or turn the feature off?" six times. Ten nights, six asks,
# one banner a night that looked exactly like every other banner — and nothing changed
# until the user happened to notice the other install had gone quiet. A signal that repeats
# at constant volume is a signal you learn to skim.
#
# So this counts the repeats mechanically and makes the Nth one look different from the
# first. L2 already writes "Sixth ask" into its own prose, but that is the model counting
# its own history from context, which is exactly the kind of number that drifts. This one
# is derived from the reports on disk.
#
# HOW A QUESTION IS IDENTIFIED
#
# By its bolded title, normalized. Verified against five consecutive cc-autodream reports
# (2026-09-10..14): the body prose is rewritten every night, but the title is BYTE-identical
# across all of them —
#   **Fix the X bookmarks walker, or turn the feature off?**
#   **Where should autodream's memory pins go now that markdown memory is retired?**
# so an exact key on the normalized title matches without any fuzzy scoring. Keying on the
# body instead is not an option precisely because the body is rewritten nightly.
#
# PROMPT.md treats the bold lead-in as REQUIRED for this reason. It used to call it
# optional, and a plain numbered question would then parse as nothing while its siblings
# parsed fine — the streak would vanish with no warning. The guard against that living on
# the prompt alone is the parsed-vs-marker check below: any disagreement between the number
# of questions parsed and the report's own count marker refuses to touch state and says so.
# Freezing every streak at its last value is the failure that would switch this feature off
# silently, which is exactly what `overlap_measured` and `stats_sidecars_unparseable` exist
# to prevent elsewhere in this repo.
#
# A streak counts CONSECUTIVE REPORTS, not calendar days: a night that produced no report
# must not reset a streak, because the whole point is to survive the nights that fail. A
# question absent from a report that WAS produced is treated as resolved and forgotten —
# including a report with zero questions, which is why run.sh calls this on the
# nothing-was-triaged path too.
#
# RERUNS
#
# Updates are idempotent per report date and refuse to go backwards. `AUTODREAM_FORCE=1
# run.sh <today>` rebuilds the same report and must not advance a streak to a false
# escalation; rebuilding an OLDER date must not clobber the live state with history. Both
# are decided from the stored last-seen date rather than trusted not to happen.
#
# Usage:
#   question-streaks.sh update <report.md> [findings-dir]   # count, escalate, notify
#   question-streaks.sh status                              # print current streaks
#   question-streaks.sh clear all|<key>                     # forget a streak once acted on
#
# Environment:
#   AUTODREAM_DIR                    default $HOME/.claude/autodream
#   AUTODREAM_QUESTION_STATE         streak store   default $AUTODREAM_DIR/question-streaks.tsv
#   AUTODREAM_QUESTION_ESCALATE_AT   escalate at N consecutive reports   default 3
#   AUTODREAM_NOTIFY_DRYRUN          1 = never post a banner (tests, dry runs)
#
# Exit: always 0 on `update`. This runs at the end of a nightly pipeline and a bookkeeping
# helper must never be the thing that costs a night its report. `clear` DOES report a
# failed write, because an operator who is told a streak is forgotten must not find it
# still escalating tomorrow.
set -uo pipefail

# install.sh links this script into the install's own AUTODREAM_DIR, so a bare invocation
