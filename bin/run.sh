# Autodream runner — invoked by launchd at ~3am local time.
#
# Two-layer pipeline:
#   L1: For each of yesterday's session JSONLs, spawn a parallel `claude --model haiku`
#       running SESSION_TRIAGE.md → writes one findings.json per session.
#   L2: One `claude --model claude-opus-5-5` (manifest pin) running PROMPT.md with Glob and Read only → reads
#       all findings JSONs and prints the report on stdout, ending with AUTODREAM_REPORT_END,
#       then an optional AUTODREAM_PINS_BEGIN/END block. run.sh is the only writer: it strips
#       the sentinel into $DREAMS_DIR/YYYY-MM-DD.md, writes pins.jsonl from the block, and
#       stores the pins in Mnemopi via apply-pins.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run.sh             # process yesterday
#   ./run.sh 2026-05-24  # process a specific date
#   FANOUT=4 ./run.sh    # tune L1 parallelism (default 8)
#
# Environment overrides (all optional):
#   CLAUDE_BIN     path to claude CLI                   default: $HOME/.local/bin/claude
#   PROJECTS_DIR   single root: where session JSONLs live (kept for compat; one root)
#                  default: $HOME/.claude/projects
#   SESSION_ROOTS  colon-separated dirs to scan for session JSONLs. Takes precedence
#                  over PROJECTS_DIR. If neither is set, every $HOME/.claude*/projects
#                  that exists is scanned (primary always first) — each CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
#                  profile keeps its own projects/ bucket, so one-dir scanning silently
#                  missed sessions recorded under ~/.claude-nous, ~/.claude-ds4, ...

#   AUTODREAM_CHANGELOG  set 0 to skip the upstream-changelog check  default: 1
#   AUTODREAM_CHANGELOG_SOURCES  override the watched harnesses. Semicolon-separated
#                        records of name|remote|path-in-repo|cache-dir. Default watches
#                        Claude Code, Codex and OMP (OMP is a monorepo with no root
#                        CHANGELOG, hence the per-source path). CHANGELOG_REMOTE selects
#                        one source alone and suppresses the others.
#   AUTODREAM_CHANGELOG_MAX_LINES  per-source cap on inserted lines          default: 400
#   CLAUDE_CODE_REPO     persistent cache for the claude-code clone  default: $AUTODREAM_DIR/cache/claude-code

#   AUTODREAM_L1_ROUNDS  max L1 retry rounds for missing sessions    default: 5
#                        Two consecutive rounds that recover no session trip a circuit
#                        breaker: the run jumps straight to the stub round rather than
#                        spending the rest of the budget on an identical failure.
#   AUTODREAM_L1_TIMEOUT seconds before an L1 worker is killed with     default: 1200
#                        its process group; needs timeout or gtimeout on PATH.
#                        Must be a positive integer (0 would disable the timeout).
#                        SIGKILL follows 30s after the SIGTERM, so the worst-case
#                        bound is AUTODREAM_L1_TIMEOUT + 30.
#   AUTODREAM_L1_WARMUP  set 0 to skip the pre-fanout auth warmup     default: 1
#                        One serial model call per adapter before the parallel dispatch, so
#                        a cold OAuth token is refreshed once instead of by FANOUT workers
#                        at once. Never fatal; result lands in run-stats as l1_warmup.
#   AUTODREAM_L1_WARMUP_TIMEOUT seconds before the warmup is killed    default: 120
#                        Must be a positive integer (0 would disable the deadline).
#   AUTODREAM_L2_ATTEMPTS max L2 attempts to produce a report        default: 3
#   AUTODREAM_RETRY_WAIT seconds to pause between retry rounds       default: 60
#   AUTODREAM_NETCHECK   set 0 to skip waiting-for-network on retry  default: 1
#   AUTODREAM_ADAPTERS   harnesses to scan: names (space/comma) or all   default: claude
#                        (an adapter under adapters/ is accepted, not enabled, until named)
#   AUTODREAM_FORCE      set 1 to rebuild even if a report exists    default: 0
#   AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES sessions larger than this are slimmed for L1  default: 262144
#   AUTODREAM_L1_CHUNK_BYTES  a transcript whose worker input is bigger than this is split at line
#                        boundaries and read by one worker per chunk, then merged into the one
#                        findings JSON per session. 0 turns chunking off and restores the head/tail
#                        slim exactly. COST: every oversized session costs up to MAX_CHUNKS worker
#                        calls instead of one, per round, so a night costs up to
#                        (oversized sessions x MAX_CHUNKS) calls plus the rest one each; a session
#                        takes up to MAX_CHUNKS x AUTODREAM_L1_TIMEOUT of wall time (its chunks run
#                        in sequence in one slot)                              default: 0 (off; 300000 is
#                        the value the replay in the PR was run with)
#   AUTODREAM_L1_MAX_CHUNKS  most chunks read per session; over it the middle is dropped and counted
#                        (l1_chunks_elided), the first half and last half are kept   default: 8
#   AUTODREAM_WINDOW     set 0 to place a session in a report day by its file mtime
#                        alone, as before. On (default) it is placed by the timestamps
#                        INSIDE the transcript, and stats and L1 see only that day  default: 1
#   AUTODREAM_L2_ENGINE  adapter whose engine runs L2                default: the first enabled adapter
#   AUTODREAM_TRIAGE     set 1 to triage each delivered report into dreams/DATE.triage.md   default: 0
#                        One extra read-only call on the L2 engine and model, after everything
#                        else (bin/triage-dream.sh; never fatal). Off, nothing changes.

# ---- Config file ----
# run.sh historically ignored ~/.claude/autodream/config; only review.sh sourced it. That
# was fine while every key it held was review-only, and stopped being fine the moment a
# key had to reach the nightly run (AUTODREAM_VAULT_DIR). Sourced here, after AUTODREAM_DIR
# is resolved — so AUTODREAM_DIR itself must come from the environment, not the config.
#
# The env-wins dance matters: the config uses plain `KEY=value`, so a bare `.` would let
# the file clobber a variable the caller deliberately exported (tests set env, and a run
# invoked as `AUTODREAM_VAULT_DIR= run.sh` to disable the vault must actually disable it).
# Snapshot the exported environment, source, then replay the snapshot: names the caller
# set win, names only the config sets survive.
#
# `set -a` around the source is the other half: the helper scripts below are separate
# processes, so a config key that stays an unexported shell variable reaches nothing.
#
# This whole script runs under `set -u` (top of file), and sourcing a user-edited file
# under nounset means ANY unbound reference in it (e.g. a typo'd
# X_CREDS_FILE=$AUTODREAM_HOME/x-credentials, meaning AUTODREAM_DIR) aborts the shell
# outright — before LOG_DIR or the log() function exist, so nothing reaches the run log
# and no report is produced. The `|| echo WARNING ...` below can't catch that: nounset
# kills the shell rather than making `.` return non-zero. run.sh never sourced this file
# before the vault-notes feature, so a typo that used to be harmless now silently costs
# a night. Two passes fix it without losing the config-key-name diagnostic:
#   1. A throwaway subshell probe sources the config under the SAME `set -u` this
#      script runs under, purely so bash's own error message (which names the exact
#      unbound variable) can be surfaced as a WARNING. A subshell dying from `set -u`
#      does not kill this shell, and nothing it does touches real state.
#   2. The real source runs with nounset OFF, so a bad reference can't abort us — it
#      degrades to an empty expansion for that one reference, and every other key
#      (before or after the bad line) still gets set and exported normally.

# spans several days was read whole for each of them (issue #113).
#
# The adapter contract is unchanged. enumerate keeps its (root, from, to) arguments and
# still filters on mtime; the runner passes it a far upper date, so the mtime test is a
# LOWER bound only (a file last written before the day began cannot hold a record from it),

# run.sh instantly while the helpers a symlinked run.sh looks for stay missing until
# install.sh runs again. The helper is run through bash, not gated on -x, for the reason
# preflight.sh is.
#
# The window is ON only when every piece of it works: the helper is there, it turns the
# report day into epoch bounds, and the far date computes and is accepted by this host's
# find. Any one missing leaves the original bounded enumeration in place, so a degraded
# install reads exactly what it read before and never fails a night over this.
# "Far" is the report day plus five years, not a year-9999 sentinel: BSD find on some macOS
# releases cannot parse a distant date and fails with "Can't parse date/time", so the date

# which is a working directory and not a checkout. install.sh symlinks each script
# individually into ~/.claude/autodream, so that directory is real and has no .git, and
# `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` resolves symlinked *directories* but not a symlinked *file* —
# it lands in the install dir every time. Six of the eight runs through 2026-08-03 wrote
# `runner_commit: unknown` for that reason alone, which is the exact blind spot #29
# existed to close. The two that did stamp a sha were launched from the repo by hand.
# SCRIPT_DIR stays as it is: helper lookup genuinely wants the install dir.
# Everything degrades to "unknown"/"no": a tarball install with no git, or no git binary
# at all, is a supported way to run this and must not fail the run.
# --untracked-files=no on the dirty check: "dirty" is meant to warn that the run used code
# that exists in nobody's history, which only tracked modifications can cause. Counting
# untracked files made the first production run report runner_dirty: yes over a stray
# scratch directory, which is exactly the kind of false alarm that gets a signal ignored.
# Still a symlink means the walk gave up (a cycle, or a chain past the cap) rather than
# arriving anywhere. Resolving the truncated path would stamp whatever checkout it happens
# to sit in, and a confidently wrong sha is worse than no sha at all — the whole point of

# entries into the findings dir for Layer 2 to read. There is no remote `git blame`/`log`,
# so we keep a persistent local cache (not a tmpdir): nightly cost is one delta `git pull`.
# git is the only dependency. Any failure is recorded in the output file, never aborts the
# pipeline. Window matches the session scan exactly, so each release is reported once.

# Three harnesses are watched, not one: the user works across Claude Code, Codex and OMP,
# and a release note only earns its place in the report when it lands in a tool actually
# in use. OMP keeps no root CHANGELOG — it is a monorepo and the CLI's log lives at
# packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md — so the path is per-source rather than assumed.
#
# One source's failure never silences the others: each gets its own cache, its own
# clone/pull and its own section, and a dead remote writes an explicit failure line into
# that section rather than an empty file that reads like a quiet night upstream.

# A laptop that sleeps mid-run loses the network and whole batches of workers fail
# (this is the common overnight failure: started on a brief wake, slept through the
# run, ~half the workers errored, L2 produced no report). The L1 worker is already
# idempotent — a session with a findings JSON is skipped — so we can just re-dispatch
# the still-missing sessions across wake/sleep cycles until they all land, and retry
# L2 until a report exists. Tunable; network-wait/sleep are disabled in tests.

# A report is COMPLETE when it carries the end-of-document marker PROMPT.md mandates, not
# merely when its path is non-empty. `-s` cannot tell a finished report from one the
# aggregator was killed halfway through writing, and a truncated report satisfies `-s`
# exactly as well as a good one. That mattered three separate ways: the L2 retry loop
# would break after attempt 1 on a partial file, the superseded good copy would be
# deleted, and the consume gate would archive the user's notes and stamp bookmarks read
# against a half-written report. Mid-write death is precisely the sleep-kill scenario all
# of this exists for, so "non-empty" was never the right test. The marker is the last
# thing PROMPT.md emits, which is what makes its presence mean the write reached the end.

# ---- Model escalation: spend a stronger L1 model where friction was MEASURED ----
# Haiku missed a real permission-gate finding that Opus reported from the same input
# (one session, one run each; the repo L1 benchmark shows the same direction), and Opus
# costs about 15x as much per run, so it is not the default for every session. The
# decision uses the stats sidecar, which counts is_error tool_result blocks (never a
# grep of the transcript, which would count prose and the system prompt).
#
# The knobs are documented in the header of this file. score = error_result_count +
# 3 * permission_denial_count. The bar of 8 was calibrated on 16 real sessions: quiet ones
# scored 0-4, the session with the real permission finding scored 8, heavy-friction ones
# 22-71. The cost of an escalated session is per CHUNK, so a multi-chunk session costs
# several calls; the MAX cap counts sessions, not chunks. Claude sessions only: the model id
# belongs to that engine, and only its stats carry the friction counts.
# Written once, before any L1 call, so every retry round sends a session to the same model.

# l1_noise_gated STATS_FILE -> exit 0 when the noise gate would skip this session. The same
# predicate the L1 worker applies (the gate block in dispatch_l1), kept here so a gated session

#
# The completeness test is the open-questions marker, not `-s`, for the same reason every
# other consumer uses it: a report killed mid-write is not a report. TARGET_DATE is skipped
# because this run is about to assemble it, and a stub findings dir left by an earlier
# attempt at the same date would otherwise report itself as a failure.
#
# The marker became mandatory partway through this tool's life, so every report written
# before that is non-empty, complete, and unmarked. Judged by the marker alone they all
# look abandoned: on this host the check named six consecutive good reports every single
# night, which is exactly how a real warning gets trained into background noise. Dates
# before AUTODREAM_MARKER_EPOCH therefore accept a non-empty report, and are reported
# under their own key so the exemption is visible rather than silent.
#
# Why a date and not a heuristic: "non-empty but unmarked" is genuinely ambiguous - it is
# either a legacy report or a truncated capture - and the only fact that separates them is
# when the contract began. The exposure is bounded by design: the scan looks back
# AUTODREAM_UNASSEMBLED_WINDOW days, so an epoch that is wrong for a given install
# self-corrects within a week of upgrading. Set it when backfilling older dates.

  # (the same threshold dispatch_l1 checks before calling slim-transcript.sh), and of
  # those, how many still ended in an in-band failure (the same top-level "error" key
  # L1_ERRORED checks above) despite the existing fallback stack (slimming, chunked-Read
  # guidance, metadata-stub path). Gate: if oversized_errored/oversized_total sustains
  # >= 5% over a trailing week, that's the signal issue #12's gate has opened; below that
  # the fallback stack is doing its job. This script only records the counters — the L2
  # self-audit and the human do the trailing-week judgment.
  # Computed post-hoc from the *.stats.json sidecars' transcript_bytes field, same
  # post-hoc pattern as GATED/L1_ERRORED above: the per-worker sz variable at dispatch
  # time (line ~309) lives in an xargs subshell with no shared state to increment
  # directly, so this re-derives it from the sidecar written before dispatch instead.
  #
  # Iterate the SESSION LIST, not the *.stats.json glob (#27). A sidecar that was never
  # written — compute_session_stats deletes the file whenever session-stats.sh fails —
  # is absent from the glob entirely, so the session it belonged to used to drop out of
  # oversized_total without appearing anywhere. Walking the worklist means every triaged
  # session is accounted for exactly once, whatever state its sidecar is in, and stale
  # sidecars left by an earlier enumeration no longer sneak into the count.
  #
  # STATS_SIDECARS_UNPARSEABLE is the shared health signal for every sidecar consumer
  # (#27). One broken sidecar corrupts several counters at once — the noise gate reads
  # the same file inside dispatch_l1 — so the failures are counted once here rather than
  # each stat carrying its own measured/not-measured flag. A sidecar counts as
  # unparseable when it is missing, empty, not valid JSON, or carries no numeric
  # transcript_bytes. The noise gate's own read is deliberately left alone: it already
  # biases to triage on an unreadable sidecar (worst case, a wasted model call), and the
  # only thing missing there was the signal, which this counter now supplies.

  # 2026-06-21 and "claude-opus-4-7" from that day on, because Fable 5 left the

  # was unreachable and the pin was simply "opus-4-7 forever" — a model two
  # generations behind by 2026-09, quietly chosen by a comment about billing.

    # answers is not a missing signal but an unchanging one — the X bookmarks question was
