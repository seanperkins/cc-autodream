# Autodream runner — invoked by launchd at ~3am local time.
#
# Two-layer pipeline:
#   L1: For each of yesterday's session JSONLs, spawn a parallel `claude --model haiku`
#       running SESSION_TRIAGE.md → writes one findings.json per session.
#   L2: One `claude --model opus` running PROMPT.md → reads all findings JSONs,
#       writes $DREAMS_DIR/YYYY-MM-DD.md plus a memory-candidates.json sidecar
#       (proposals only; bin/promote.sh writes accepted ones to Mnemopi).
#
# Usage:
#   ./run.sh             # process yesterday
#   ./run.sh 2026-05-24  # process a specific date
#   FANOUT=4 ./run.sh    # tune L1 parallelism (default 8)
#
# Environment overrides (all optional):
#   CLAUDE_BIN     path to claude CLI                   default: $HOME/.local/bin/claude
#   PROJECTS_DIR   single root: where session JSONLs live (kept for compat; one root)

#                  that exists is scanned (primary always first) — each CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR

# ---- Config file ----
# run.sh historically ignored ~/.claude/autodream/config; only review.sh sourced it. That
# was fine while every key it held was review-only, and stopped being fine the moment a
# key had to reach the nightly run (AUTODREAM_VAULT_DIR). Sourced here, after AUTODREAM_DIR
# is resolved — so AUTODREAM_DIR itself must come from the environment, not the config.
#
# The env-wins dance matters: the config uses plain `KEY=value`, so a bare `.` would let
# the file clobber a variable the caller deliberately exported (tests set env, and a run
# invoked as `AUTODREAM_VAULT_DIR= run.sh` to disable the vault must actually disable it).
# Snapshot the exported environment, source, then replay the snapshot: names the caller
# set win, names only the config sets survive.
#
# `set -a` around the source is the other half: the helper scripts below are separate
# processes, so a config key that stays an unexported shell variable reaches nothing.
#
# This whole script runs under `set -u` (top of file), and sourcing a user-edited file
# under nounset means ANY unbound reference in it (e.g. a typo'd
# X_CREDS_FILE=$AUTODREAM_HOME/x-credentials, meaning AUTODREAM_DIR) aborts the shell
# outright — before LOG_DIR or the log() function exist, so nothing reaches the run log
# and no report is produced. The `|| echo WARNING ...` below can't catch that: nounset
# kills the shell rather than making `.` return non-zero. run.sh never sourced this file
# before the vault-notes feature, so a typo that used to be harmless now silently costs
# a night. Two passes fix it without losing the config-key-name diagnostic:
#   1. A throwaway subshell probe sources the config under the SAME `set -u` this
#      script runs under, purely so bash's own error message (which names the exact
#      unbound variable) can be surfaced as a WARNING. A subshell dying from `set -u`
#      does not kill this shell, and nothing it does touches real state.
#   2. The real source runs with nounset OFF, so a bad reference can't abort us — it
#      degrades to an empty expansion for that one reference, and every other key
#      (before or after the bad line) still gets set and exported normally.

# individually into ~/.claude/autodream, so that directory is real and has no .git, and

# it lands in the install dir every time. Six of the eight runs through 2026-08-03 wrote

# existed to close. The two that did stamp a sha were launched from the repo by hand.

# ---- Sleep/network resilience helpers ----
# A laptop that sleeps mid-run loses the network and whole batches of workers fail
# (this is the common overnight failure: started on a brief wake, slept through the
# run, ~half the workers errored, L2 produced no report). The L1 worker is already
# idempotent — a session with a findings JSON is skipped — so we can just re-dispatch
# the still-missing sessions across wake/sleep cycles until they all land, and retry
# L2 until a report exists. Tunable; network-wait/sleep are disabled in tests.

# A report is COMPLETE when it carries the end-of-document marker PROMPT.md mandates, not
# merely when its path is non-empty. `-s` cannot tell a finished report from one the
# aggregator was killed halfway through writing, and a truncated report satisfies `-s`
# exactly as well as a good one. That mattered three separate ways: the L2 retry loop

  # ---- Oversized-transcript measurement gate (#12) ----

  # that implementation is BLOCKED pending evidence it's actually needed. These two
  # counters are the measurement: how many triaged sessions exceeded AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES
  # (the same threshold dispatch_l1 checks before calling slim-transcript.sh), and of
  # those, how many still ended in an in-band failure (the same top-level "error" key
  # L1_ERRORED checks above) despite the existing fallback stack (slimming, chunked-Read
  # guidance, metadata-stub path). Gate: if oversized_errored/oversized_total sustains
  # >= 5% over a trailing week, that's the signal issue #12's gate has opened; below that
  # the fallback stack is doing its job. This script only records the counters — the L2
  # self-audit and the human do the trailing-week judgment.
  # Computed post-hoc from the *.stats.json sidecars' transcript_bytes field, same
  # post-hoc pattern as GATED/L1_ERRORED above: the per-worker sz variable at dispatch
  # time (line ~309) lives in an xargs subshell with no shared state to increment
  # directly, so this re-derives it from the sidecar written before dispatch instead.
  #
  # Iterate the SESSION LIST, not the *.stats.json glob (#27). A sidecar that was never
  # written — compute_session_stats deletes the file whenever session-stats.sh fails —
  # is absent from the glob entirely, so the session it belonged to used to drop out of
  # oversized_total without appearing anywhere. Walking the worklist means every triaged
  # session is accounted for exactly once, whatever state its sidecar is in, and stale
  # sidecars left by an earlier enumeration no longer sneak into the count.
  #
  # STATS_SIDECARS_UNPARSEABLE is the shared health signal for every sidecar consumer
  # (#27). One broken sidecar corrupts several counters at once — the noise gate reads
  # the same file inside dispatch_l1 — so the failures are counted once here rather than
  # each stat carrying its own measured/not-measured flag. A sidecar counts as
  # unparseable when it is missing, empty, not valid JSON, or carries no numeric

# ---- The logger must not be able to take the run down with it ----
# `run 2>&1 | tee -a "$RUN_LOG"` turns every log line into a write to a pipe, so whatever
# kills tee kills the run on its very next log call — by SIGPIPE, with no error line,
# before the L2 retry loop, the move-aside blocks, or the consume gate are ever reached.
# Three runs on 2026-08-02 died exactly there and left 2026-08-01 with no report at all:
# `Terminated: 15` on tee, `Broken pipe: 13` on run, and a log ending mid-sentence at
# "L2 aggregation attempt 1/3...". Every recovery path in this script assumes it gets to
# run, and a logger that can revoke that assumption defeats all of them at once.
#
# A file has no reader to lose, so that is where an unattended run writes. Ignoring
# SIGPIPE covers the interactive path too, where tee is still worth having and a closed
# terminal should cost the run its output rather than its life.
