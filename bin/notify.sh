# Write the "Open questions" section of an autodream report to a text file, post a
# persistent macOS notification, and pop it open in the user's editor. Quiet no-op if
# there are no questions.
#
# The banner is the reliable signal: the nightly run fires ~3am under launchd, when a
# GUI window open silently fails to surface. `display notification` posts to
# Notification Center, which persists until dismissed, so the alert is waiting whenever
# the Mac is next used. The direct open stays as a best-effort convenience on top.
#
# Usage: notify.sh <report.md>
#
# Environment overrides:
#   AUTODREAM_DIR   scripts + state           default: $HOME/.claude/autodream
#   AUTODREAM_OPEN  command that opens the inbox file. Run through `sh -c`, so flags
#                   work: "subl", "code -g", "open -a Obsidian".
#                   default: open (macOS hands the file to the default .md app)
#   SUBL            deprecated alias for AUTODREAM_OPEN, honored for existing setups
#   AUTODREAM_NOTIFY_DRYRUN
#                   1 = report the question count and exit. Writes no inbox file, posts
#                   no banner, opens nothing. Use this to check what a report WOULD do.

# that survived its triviality gate — the same marker review.sh reads to decide whether
# the morning triage session is worth opening. That marker is authoritative because it is
# the only source that knows which candidates L2 considered and dropped; everything else
# is counting list markers and hoping they line up with questions.
#
# They don't. Measured against the 14 reports on disk when this was written, the old
# single-pass grep disagreed with the marker on 4 of the 9 reports that carry one. The
# 2026-07-24 report is the clearest: 1 real question, counted as 6, because the "Other
# findings dropped by the gate" bullets below it each scored. A banner claiming six
# questions over one is how you teach someone to stop reading banners.
#
# Reports written before the marker contract have none, so they fall back to a tiered
# heuristic — take the FIRST format tier that matches, since L2 has emitted this section
# as a numbered list, as bullets under bold subheadings, as plain bullets, and as bare
# prose, and counting every tier at once double-counts the sub-bullets under an item.
# A "None ..." lead-in is the shape review.sh already recognises as zero and must stay

# Persistent banner — survives the 3am launchd run regardless of GUI state.
# Best-effort: a notification failure must never break the run.
#
# Resilience note (learned the hard way, 2026-06): a banner's exit code does NOT prove it
# was shown. If the sender's notification permission is off — or a Focus/Do-Not-Disturb
# suppresses it — macOS silently drops the banner to Notification Center and the command
# still exits 0. The branded cc-autodream.app bundle is its OWN sender, so when branding
# was introduced macOS treated it as a new app defaulting to notifications-off, and every
# nightly banner vanished for a week while the log read "posted". That auth state is
# TCC-protected and unreadable from a script, so we cannot detect the drop.
#
# Defense: fire BOTH senders. terminal-notifier gives the CLICKABLE, branded banner
# (-execute opens the inbox in Sublime; -group collapses repeats). osascript posts through
# the system's already-trusted sender as a backup floor, so one blacked-out sender can't
# black out the whole alert. The osascript backup is silent (no -sound) to avoid a double
# chime when both land; set AUTODREAM_NOTIFY_OSA_BACKUP=0 to suppress the backup entirely.
# NOTE: for click-to-open, the cc-autodream sender's style must be "Alerts" (not "Banners",
# which auto-dismiss) in System Settings ▸ Notifications, and allowed through any Focus.
