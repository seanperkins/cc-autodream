# Resolve every session citation in a finished report against the findings dir it was
# aggregated from. Deterministic, model-free: artifacts only, no network, no model calls.
#
# Why this exists. L2 cites sessions by their 12-hex findings hash. On 2026-08-18 the
# top-ranked pattern quoted `47eba605cf1e` at "line 439/456/471" with a detailed
# `kSecUseAuthenticationUISkip` diagnosis — but that session was noise-gated, so its
# findings record is a bare stub:
#     {"session_path":"...","skipped":"below_noise_gate","findings":[],"project":"-p"}
# The quote actually lives in 6f38f3cbed43, a different session in the same project. The
# analysis was sound and the content real; only the ID was wrong, and an open question
# inherited the bad ID. A gated stub still carries `project`, which is exactly what makes
# the wrong hash look plausible to the aggregator.
#
# 10 of 11 citations that night resolved correctly, so this is a per-citation defect
# rather than a broken report — the kind that survives review because spot-checking one
# or two citations passes. Counting it makes it visible from the artifact, which is how
# every other regression in this repo is caught. No verdict, no gating: the report still
# ships, the morning review just knows which citations not to trust.
#
# Usage:
#   citation-check.sh <report.md> <findings-dir>
#
# Prints KEY: VALUE lines on stdout (the caller decides where they land — run.sh appends
# them to run-stats.txt):
#   citations_total       distinct 12-hex hashes cited in the report
#   citations_unresolved  cited hashes with no findings record at all
#   citations_to_gated    cited hashes whose record is a noise-gate stub
#   citations_unresolved_list / citations_to_gated_list   the offending hashes, or empty
#
# Exit 0 whenever the check ran, whatever it found: a citation defect is a reported
# measurement, not a runner failure. Exit 2 only when it could not run at all (missing
# report, missing findings dir, no jq) so a silent 0/0/0 can never be mistaken for a
# clean report.

# Citations appear in two shapes, because L2 formatting varies run to run: backticked
# (`47eba605cf1e`) and bare in a comma list ((c7b79782412d, 98e07eeaad42, ...)). Matching
# only the backticked form scored the 2026-08-18 pre-fix report at citations_total: 0 —
# a false all-clear, the single output this check exists to prevent. So: any 12-hex run
# whose neighbours are not hex. A 40-char commit SHA is therefore not split into
# citations, and a 7-char short SHA is too short to match.
#
# The bias is deliberate and one-directional: a stray hex token surfaces as unresolved
# (a false alarm a human dismisses in seconds), never as a clean report. Same judgement
# as the substantive filter, which keeps an unparseable session rather than dropping it.
#
# Implementation: replace every non-hex character with a space, split to one token per
# line, keep tokens that are exactly 12 hex characters. That is the boundary rule without
# needing \K, which BSD grep lacks.
